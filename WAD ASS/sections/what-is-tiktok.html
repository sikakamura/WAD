  <h2>What is tiktok</h2>
  <p>
    Tiktok is a video-sharing app where users create short-format videos and
    upload them to the platform. It’s owned by a Chinese company, Bytedance,
    which acquired Musical.ly in 2016 and rebranded it as TikTok. It’s now the
    fastest growing social media app with over 1 billion monthly active users to
    date. In the 4th quarter of 2021 alone, it had over 160 million installs.
    More than 60% of TikTok’s users are aged 10-29, but there has been a steady
    rise in older users. TikTok’s popularity soared when people locked in their
    homes during the pandemic turned to the platform for entertainment. What
