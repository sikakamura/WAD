    Exploring TikTok Challenges
  </h2>
  <P> <a href="#">Challenges</a> unite the TikTok community. Anyone can create and participate in a challenge. Challenges often involve performing a specific action and using a required hashtag. Challenges can be organic or brand-sponsored. 
    Brands use challenges to create hype over their marketing campaigns. For example, Chipotle has been running their <a href="#">#Boorito</a> challenge twice in a row. They <a href="#">partnered with influencers</a> to kickstart the challenge for them, then watched as various TikTok users joined the bandwagon. Brand challenges usually have prizes for winning users.</P>
