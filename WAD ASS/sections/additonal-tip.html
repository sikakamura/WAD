    <h2>Additional Tips to Become a TikTok Pro User</h2>
    <p>Here are extra tips and hacks to master TikTok and become a power user in no time. </p>
    <h3>1. Upload videos recorded outside TikTok</h3>
    <p>Sometimes, you record a video on your phone and edit using video editing software. You post this video on YouTube and Instagram and would like to do the same on TikTok.  </p>
    <p>To accomplish this, tap the plus icon in the middle to open the recording screen. Select the Upload button on the lower right corner beside the big record button. You’d open your phone’s gallery and select the video you want. You can add more than one video by selecting the first video, then tapping Upload and selecting the next one. </p>
    <p>When you’ve selected all the videos you want, just hit Next and proceed to edit the video using TikTok’s editing tools. </p>
    <h3>2. Create engaging photo slideshows using Templates</h3>
    <p>When you open the recording screen, swipe to choose the Templates option. Select the slideshow template you want, and each template requires a different number of photos. Once you select a template, it opens your phone’s gallery, and you can select the photos you want. </p>
    <p>Remember that the order of the photos in the slideshow will depend on the order you select them. When done, click OK at the bottom of the screen to proceed to the editing stage.</p>
    <h3>3. Delete Your TikTok Videos</h3>
    <p>If you’ve accidentally uploaded a video, you can still delete it. Just go to your profile and open the video. Select the three dots below the Share option, and choose delete.</p>
    <h3>4. Create GIFs from Any TikTok Video</h3>
    <p>You can turn any video you like into a GIF and share it with others. Simply tap the arrow button on the right side of the video and select the Share as GIF option. </p>
    <p>It will open an editing page where you can edit the length of the GIF. When done, select Generate to create the GIF. 

        TikTok is famous for meme content, and creating GIFs is one way to capitalize on this trend.</p>
    <h3>5. Share your Profile using your TikTok QR Code</h3>
    <p>Every TikTok user has their QR code from the moment they sign up. You can find this by going to your profile, tapping the three dots at the top right corner, and selecting the QR code. You can download your QR code and post it on other social media channels. </p>
    <p>To scan someone else’s QR code, just tap Scan in the top-right corner of the main screen.</p>
