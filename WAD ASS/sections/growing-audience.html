    <h2>Growing Your TikTok Audience</h2>
    <p>A large audience is important to get monetized in TikTok. Fortunately, TikTok’s algorithm makes it easy for your videos to get discovered quickly. Here are ways to <small style="color: rgb(233, 35, 85);" >get more followers on TikTok</small>.</p>
    <p> 1. Know your <small style=" color: rgb(233, 35, 85);" >target audience</small> <br>
        2. Participate in <small style=" color: rgb(233, 35, 85);" >TikTok trends</small>. <br>
        3. Create and join TikTok challenges. <br>
        4. <small style=" color: rgb(233, 35, 85);" >Collaborate</small> with other TikTok influencers. <br>
        5. Post videos regularly and at the right time. <br>
        6. Use the right hashtags. <br>
        7. Cross-promote your TikTok videos to your other channels. <br>
        8. Engage with other videos. <br>
        9. Use TikTok Promote</p>
    <p>When you know your ideal audience, you’d be able to create content that they love. This will attract them to your videos and follow your account. </p>
    <p>The best way to gain visibility on TikTok is by participating in challenges and trending hashtags. This lets other users discover your videos. Just remember to always use the right hashtags and avoid any typo errors. </p>
    <p>Just like other social media apps, engaging with other people’s content and collaborating with other influencers expands your network. Because of TikTok Duet and Stitch, engaging with other videos – especially popular ones – is easy. </p>
    <p>Consistency is also important when building an audience. You want your followers to always see your videos. <small style=" color: rgb(233, 35, 85);" >Statistics</small> show that the average user spends 52 minutes per day on the app, with younger demographics spending up to 90 minutes. That’s a lot of videos to watch, and if you’re not posting content regularly, your videos may get lost in the feed. </p>
    <p>TikTok Analytics lets you know when your followers are most active, so you can post during those times.</p>
    <p>Don’t neglect your audience on other social media platforms. Let them know that you’re now on TikTok and invite them to follow you. Cross-post your TikTok videos to your Instagram, Facebook, and other social media accounts. Include links to your TikTok profile so they can easily visit your account. </p>
    <p>If you still want to <small style=" color: rgb(233, 35, 85);" >reach a wider audience base</small>, you can always pay to promote your TikTok videos. TikTok allows creators to promote their videos using the promote option, available in the settings section from your Profile, or the … option in your videos. </p>
