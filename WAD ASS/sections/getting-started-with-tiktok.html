  <h2>Getting Started with TikTok</h2>
  <h4>Creating A TikTok Account</h4>
  <p>
    Go to Google Play or the App Store and download TikTok. As soon as you’re
    done installing and opening the app, it will start displaying videos. In
    TikTok, you don’t need an account to start browsing videos. But to start
    recording and posting videos, you need to create one. TikTok makes it easy
    to sign up by allowing you to connect your existing accounts like Facebook,
    Gmail, or Twitter. You can also create a standard username and password
    using your email or phone number.
