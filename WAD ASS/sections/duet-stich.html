        Exploring TikTok Duet and Stitch
    </h2>
    <p>Another fun way to use TikTok is through duets and stitch. A TikTok duet is when you join in another user’s video. TikTok stitch lets you use another user’s video as part of your own.</p>
    <p>To use the TikTok duet, find a video you’d interact with, and tap the share icon. Select Duet. Your recording screen will appear as two side-by-side videos. The other video will play as soon as you press record. You can also use the same recording and editing tools.

      <p>TikTok Stitch is great for creating reaction videos. To use this feature, tap the share icon on the original video, and select stitch. Wait a few moments for the video to be processed, and once done, it’ll show a screen where you cut up to 5 seconds of the original video to use for your own. Tap next, and you’ll see the regular recording screen where you can create a new ending for the video. </p>
      <p>Using TikTok Duet and Stitch, creators can come up with endless creative ideas that can make them viral and overnight sensations.
